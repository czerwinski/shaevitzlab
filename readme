A rough description of the code structure

1.  Start in KymoMain, setup GUI handles and callbacks.
2.  We load an image stack and search for images with postfix _YFP, _Red, and 
    _DIC.
3.  User inputs rectangular ROIs. (Could be polygons, but rectangles are easier 
    to use.) We do thresholding to isolate the cells, then we do morphological 
    ops to get binary contours (edges) and retracts (thinnings).
4.  From the contours and retracts, we perform 2-pass interpolation: first to 
    extend the retract to the contour poles, then to find the total spline.
5.  We find the normal lines uniform along the spline and keep the pixel coords 
    that lie along the normals.
6.  Finally we generate the kymograph by taking intensity values along the 
    normal pixels for each line over all the (sorted) frames.
